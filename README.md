6 Hours of Video Instruction

Spring is the most used framework for building services and applications and getting them to production. Today’s applications need to scale more and more to handle more users and content with the increasing demand. Reactive Spring Boot LiveLessons, by Josh Long, Spring Developer Advocate, introduces key concepts of reactive programming and examines different aspects of the Spring ecosystem that lend themselves to the functional and reactive style of programming.

These videos not only show you where to start and how to build these applications, but they also provide a solid foundation that will allow you to apply the skills learned to other parts of the Spring ecosystem that build on these core concepts.

About the Instructor

Josh Long (@starbuxman) is the first Spring Developer Advocate. Josh is a Java Champion, author of many books (including O'Reilly's Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry and the self-published Reactive Spring) and six best-selling video trainings (including Building Microservices with Spring Boot LiveLessons with Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti, and Vaadin).

Course Requirements

Basic Java familiarity. The course uses Java 8, although Spring Boot and most Spring projects support Java 6.

Lesson Descriptions

Lesson 1, “Basics,” examines what motivates the move to reactive programming and how it is supported in the Reactive Streams specification.

Lesson 2, “Data,” covers the importance of data and how Spring supports non-blocking data access for any NoSQL and SQL data stores.

Lesson 3, “HTTP Services,” focuses on what reactive programming means in an HTTP environment. It introduces functional reactive HTTP handlers, `@RestController`-stylecontrollers, reactive server-sent event streams and more.

Lesson 4, “WebSockets,” focuses on Websockets, a binary protocol that supports bi-directional communication. This lesson examines how websockets, which are an extension to HTTP, integrate with Reactive Streams.

Lesson 5, “HTTP Clients,” briefly reviews the `Webclient`, the reactive HTTP client. It also discusses some patterns that clients will care about when dealing with distributed services. After incrementally building up from basic reactive pipelines to data access and then HTTP and websockets, Lesson 6, “RSocket,” introduces RSocket. RSocket is a binary protocol that supports full duplex bi-directional communication, fully integrated in Spring Framework 5.2 and Spring Boot.

Lesson 7, “Security,” shows how Spring Security works flawlessly to protect HTTP and RSocket-based services.

Lesson 8, “Gateway,” examines how to use Spring Cloud Gateway and how it is used to act as an API gateway for HTTP- and RSocket-based services.

Lesson 9, “Reactive Streams Redux,” focuses on the Reactive Streams specification as a compatibility layer and shows how to use the Reactive Stream types as a mechanism for interoperability across opensource projects like Akka Streams, Vert.x. Spring Web Flux, and Spring Data.

The last lesson, Lesson 10 “Reactive Streams Redux,” briefly reviews testing reactive applications and covers Reactive data access, Reactive web services, and how to test reactive microservices.
